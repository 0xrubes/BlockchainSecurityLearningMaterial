# BlockchainSecurityLearningMaterial

My documented, personal learning journey to become a Blockchain Security-Chad.


Update Jan 2023: Since November I'm working at Quantstamp as an Auditing Engineer II and I'm loving it. The roughly 2 months of diving deep into Web3 security and completing the two CTFs together with reading a whole bunch of blog posts and twitter threads gave me a great starting point. I also brushed up my Web2 security knowledge, leetcode-skills and software architecture knowledge, which is not part of this repository. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
